# Messages Matthias:

- Thanks for the leftcanonicalmpo method! Looks good!

# Messages Damiano:

- cleaned up / integrated the comments from your implementation ideas into the steps.

- implemented a working leftcanonicalmpo with tests.

- improved leftcanonicalmpo: now it only uses your tensor_svd function, without transforming mpo to mps. can soon delete leftcanonicalmpo_old
