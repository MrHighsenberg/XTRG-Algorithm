- I updated the linear intialization, thank you for spotting that we would have multiplied by 1e-6^L. I think it's most convenient to
distribute the weight on all local MPO tensors equally. This does not involve too small numbers, so it should be fine.

- As for the square_mpo method, they don't use it in the paper but use the variational optimization to get close to rho(2*beta). This has 
advantageous scaling because we want to make use of the fact that the bond dimension need to increase only linearly in beta - therefore the
naive square method increases the bond dimension too quick. However, we can use it to check our results (and also truncate rho eventually to
see that nothing really changes as long as we provide enough weight for the expected scaling of S propto log(beta)).

- We will need to find out how to get our MPO into canonical form before starting the variational update. Having finished this, the result 
corresponds to the state rho(2*beta).
