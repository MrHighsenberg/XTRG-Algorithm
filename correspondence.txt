- I updated the linear intialization, thank you for spotting the error. In fact, I verified that we have to multiply by beta^(1/L) as in each
summand of the global Hamiltonian there appears one operator from each local MPO tensors, so we have to distribute the weight between them. 

- I have created another notebook, where we can document our progress and distribute the work
