- Modified the storage of the updated rho2 tensor in the XTRG update (only complex conjugate during
 the environment updates seemed more efficient in the end)

- States are not normalized anymore and leftcanonicalized in the beginning of each XTRG update (this should do the job, seems like we may 
not need rightcanonicalmpo! and sitecanonicalmpo!)

- Changed the canonicalization methods to in-place updates

- Added the trace_mpo function with a unit test, and integrated the line in the XTRG update

- Finished the main XTRG algorithm function and prepared for execution, plotting against analytical partition function set up

- Plot looks not too bad even even though there's orders of magnitude in difference, the curve shape looks fine though compared to the
analytical solutions. Seems like we're missing out on some factors (hopefully only that). Need your help to check what I've missed here!

- Running the jupyter notebook with...
    . Nsteps = 20 takes about 1 min on my laptop and convergence is always successful;
    . Nsteps = 21 takes about 2 mins but for the last step, beta = 1.048576 ---> beta = 2.097152, you violate your convergence threshold (with convergence=1e-8), but the corresponding last dot in the plot still looks fine;
    . with Nsteps = 22 the last step (beta = 1.048576 ---> beta = 2.097152) runs on and on but nothing gets printed relative to the last step (beta = 2.097152 ---> beta = 4. ...) (why? is it super super slow, or does sth go wrong?)

- Comment on the lack of convergence for Nsteps > 20: after about the first 20 steps/for beta = O(1), the non-normalized state exp(- beta H) starts significantly differing from identity. This is seen in the plot beta |--> Z as well, where one sees that Z is basically constant and equal to trace(identity) = 2^L = 1024 throughout the first 20 steps, and then suddenly starts gaining orders of magnitude. Why is O(1) the "critical" order of magnitude for beta, beyond which things change? Because the matrix elements of H have the order of magnitude of J = 1. Or better, the eigenvalues of H with largest absolute value are O(J*L), as they are sums of O(L) single-fermion eigenvalues epsilon_k. Then as long as beta << 1, the exponent -beta H is "close to zero", or equivalently the non-normalized state exp(- beta H) is close to identity. Long story short: the initial beta_0 and the maximal number of steps Nsteps = 20 we were instructed to use were computed as solutions of the "equation" 2^(Nsteps) * beta_0 * (biggest eigenvalue of H) = O(1), with (biggest eigenvalue of H) = O(J * L) = O(10).

...but then is XTRG really useful to explore low temperature/high beta physics?

- everything works just as well with square = false in XTRG_update/algorithm, and takes actulally a bit faster (like, half the time as  with square = true for Nsteps = 21, 22)

- with my university macbook Nsteps = 22/23 is also working in less than 10 mins! (with either square = true or false). We can probably push a bit further, also by tweaking parameters. we can come back to this after the presentation is ready.

- added normalization to singualr values. things didnt work a nicely as i hoped if one normalizes with roots of Z. Instead singular values are now just normalized s.t. they add up to 1 (for a given temperature and given site)
