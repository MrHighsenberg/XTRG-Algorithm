# Messages Matthias:

- For the implementation of the contraction for the Frobenius norm, we can use the updateLeftEnv function with trivial tensors C and B.

- I have finished the code for the updateLeftEnv and tensor_svd function and added some unit tests for them.

# Messages Damiano:

- cleaned up / integrated the comments from your implementation ideas into the steps.

- implemented a working leftcanonicalmpo with tests.

- improved leftcanonicalmpo: now it only uses your tensor_svd function, without transforming mpo to mps. can soon delete leftcanonicalmpo_old
