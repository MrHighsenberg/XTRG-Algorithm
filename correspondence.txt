- I updated the linear intialization, thank you for spotting the error. In fact, I verified that we have to multiply by beta^(1/L) as in each
summand of the global Hamiltonian there appears one operator from each local MPO tensors, so we have to distribute the weight between them. 

- I have created another notebook, where we can document our progress and distribute the work

- You are right it should be (-beta)^(1/L)

- Thanks for fixing the beta^(1/L) factor (no idea why i suggested a log). I think there may still be a sign issue in case L is even though, i think we can just put a sign in front of e.g. the first site tensor H_mpo[1]

- I see your point with the workflow notebook, good idea

- to be discussed later: 1) who does what, 2) how do we initialize the squared mpo before the sweeping?

- ok lets go for (-beta)^(1/L) in the sense exp(i*pi/L) * beta^(1/L)
