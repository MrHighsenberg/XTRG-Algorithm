- Modified the storage of the updated rho2 tensor in the XTRG update (only complex conjugate during
 the environment updates seemed more efficient in the end)

- States are not normalized anymore and leftcanonicalized in the beginning of each XTRG update (this should do the job, seems like we may 
not need rightcanonicalmpo! and sitecanonicalmpo!)

- Changed the canonicalization methods to in-place updates

- Added the trace_mpo function with a unit test, and integrated the line in the XTRG update

- Finished the main XTRG algorithm function and prepared for execution, plotting against analytical partition function set up

- Plot looks not too bad even even though there's orders of magnitude in difference, the curve shape looks fine though compared to the
analytical solutions. Seems like we're missing out on some factors (hopefully only that). Need your help to check what I've missed here!
