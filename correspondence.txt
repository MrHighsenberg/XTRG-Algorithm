- Thanks for the leftcanonicalmpo method! Looks good!

- Have now also implemented mpo_normalize! which we will need after the linear initialization. Also now by construction the very last MPO tensor
  in the chain becomes left-canonicalized as well.

- Updated the add_mpo function, we store boundary mpo tensors always such that the respective last bond dimension equals 1, in that way all the 
  canonicalization and normalization functions work properly.

- Implemented the rightcanonicalmpo method and the sitecanonicalmpo method which follows quickly.

- Implemented a provisional version of the XTRG update function.

- If you have some time, please keep working on the powerpoint by also integrating the relevant formula and figures from the paper. We have only 
have four more days left to get the presentation finished.
