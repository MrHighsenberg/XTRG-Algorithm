# Messages Matthias:

- Modified the storage of the updated rho2 tensor in the XTRG update (only complex conjugate during
 the environment updates seemed more efficient in the end)

- States are not normalized anymore and leftcanonicalized in the beginning of each XTRG update (this should do the job, seems like we may 
not need rightcanonicalmpo! and sitecanonicalmpo!)

- Changed the canonicalization methods to in-place updates

- Added the trace_mpo function with a unit test, and integrated the line in the XTRG update
