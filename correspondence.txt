# Messages Matthias:

- For the implementation of the contraction for the Frobenius norm, we can use the updateLeftEnv function with trivial tensors C and B.

- I have finished the code for the updateLeftEnv and tensor_svd function and added some unit tests for them.

# Messages Damiano:

- cleaned up / integrated the comments from your implementation ideas into the steps.

- added tests for mpo left canonicalization, will implement function on friday
