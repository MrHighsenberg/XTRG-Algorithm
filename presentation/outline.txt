Presentation outline (tot 16/17 slides, 35/40 mins):

1) INTRODUCTION (1 slide)
- basic theoretical idea of method (operator level, no tensor networks)
- we'll apply method to 1D XY model and compare to analytical solution
2) METHOD (4/5 slides)
- XTRG algorithm
- XTRG update, i.e. how exactly we approximate/compress the square of an MPO
- linear initialization
3) CODE (9 slides, 1 slide per main method, to go through quickly. Title + one-line description + one line on why needed + drawing + code screenshot)
In order:
- add_mpo / add operators in MPO representation / we need this for linear initialization, rho (beta0) = ...
- canonical forms, e.g. leftcanonicalmpo! / bring an MPO to left-canonical form by treating it as an MPS (with merged physical legs) / needed to simplify the minimization equations during XTRG update
- square_mpo (for XTRG step, eith result to be compressed) / square operators in MPO representation / needed as a starting poin in XTRG update (recall: e^... beta -> ... 2beta = ... beta ..^2), to be later compressed
- updateLeftEnv / get left and right environment tensors V_L, V_R needed in the update of C_l C_{l+1} from the environment tensors used to update C_{l-1} C_l / needed to update the tensors C_l that make up the approximation of e^{-2beta..}
- normalize_mpo / noramlize an operator O in MPO form with the Frobenius norm ||O||_F / used to keep track of convergence (with O = ...)
- trace_mpo / compute trace of an operator in MPO form / needed to compute Z = tr(...)
- XTRG_update / this function combines all previous functions and more. in essence, it takes as input an MPO (for us,  e^.. in MPO form) and returns its square in MPO, after truncation 
- XTRG_algorithm /  function that calls XTRG_update iteratively, and returns data (......) from all iterations
4) RESULTS ON XY model (3 slides)
- basics on analytics
- show plot for Z(beta)
- singular value plots
- explain why we cannot go beyond 20 steps; raise doubts on how one can actually reach low T 
*Here, if time allows, we can OPEN JUPYTER NOTEBOOK and run all of it. Would make sense, since we made an effort in keeping the notebook non-technical*
5) SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS (1 slide)
