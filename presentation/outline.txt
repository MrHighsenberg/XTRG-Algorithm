Presentation outline (tot 16/17 slides, 35/40 mins):

1) INTRODUCTION (1 slide)
- basic theoretical idea of method (operator level, no tensor networks)
- we'll apply method to 1D XY model and compare to analytical solution
2) METHOD (4/5 slides)
- XTRG algorithm
- XTRG update, i.e. how exactly we approximate/compress the square of an MPO
- linear initialization
3) CODE (9 slides, 1 slide per main method, to go through quickly. Title + one-line description + drawing + code screenshot)
- updateLeftEnv
- add_mpo (needed for linear initialization)
- square_mpo (for XTRG step, eith result to be compressed)
- trace_mpo
- normalize_mpo (for convergence checks)
- canonical forms, e.g. left 
- XTRG_update
- XTRG_algorithm
4) RESULTS ON XY model (3 slides)
- basics on analytics
- show plot for Z(beta)
- singular value plots
- explain why we cannot go beyond 20 steps; raise doubts on how one can actually reach low T 
*Here, if time allows, we can OPEN JUPYTER NOTEBOOK and run all of it. Would make sense, since we made an effort in keeping the notebook non-technical*
5) SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS (1 slide)
