    "Here is a possible scheme for implementing `square_mpo`, the function that takes as parameters an `mpo`, an upper bound `Dmax` to the bond dimension, and a number `Nsweeps` of sweeps, and returns an mpo `mpo2` representing the square of the operator represented my `mpo`. See source/square_mpo.jl for better description of what this function `square_mpo` should do. There, the easy case where (bond dimension of `mpo`)^2 <= Dmax is already implemented (no truncation is needed, so easy!). Here let's assume (bond dimension of `mpo`)^2 > Dmax, which requires truncation and actually understanding appendix D of the paper (sigh). This scheme closely follows ideas and in particular the indexing conventions of the lecture function `dmrg_2site`! Having a tab open with the implementation of `dmrg_2site` may help understand the scheme below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Get as parameters `mpo` to be squared, `Dmax`, and `Nsweeps`\n",
    "- Initialize `mpo2` (will be output) as a copy of `mpo` (...any better ideas?) with enlarged bond dimension = `Dmax`. one has to add a bunch of zeros (1)\n",
    "- by reshaping `mpo2` to an mps (by joining its physical legs), bring it to left-canonical form. Then reshape it back to the mpo form (by disjoining physical legs) (2)\n",
    "- initialize `Vlr` as `Hlr` in `dmrg_2site`. roughly speaking `Vlr[l + 1]` will contain the environment tensors $V_{L/R}$ (see fig. 17c in the paper) relative to site `l` when the algorithm/sweeping is working at a couple of site that are on the right/left of site `l`.\n",
    "- Fill `Vlr[2], ..., Vlr[L + 1]` with iterative contractions of `mpo`, `mpo` and `mpo2`. For that, we can use a modified version of updateLeft, say `updateLeft_mod` (3), doing what's described in fig. 17c\n",
    "- Start a for cycle with the index `itS = (1:Nsweeps)`\n",
    "- RIGHT TO LEFT SWEEP: `for itL = (L:-1:2)`, update (4) as in appendix D `mpo2[itL-1]` and `mpo2[itL]`. This involves `Vlr[itL-1]` as left environment $V_L$ and `Vlr[itL + 2]` as right environment $V_R$. It also involves an SVD (5) to get `mpo2[itL-1]` and `mpo2[itL]` out of the 2-site optimized tensor ($C_i C_{i+1}$ in the paper). In particular, the updated `mpo2[itL]` must be an \"MPO-right isometry\", so that the updated `mpo2`  will be \"MPO-site canonical\" with new isometry center at site `itL - 1` (still need to really get the details of all that...). After that, update `Vlr[itL + 1]` using `updateLeft_mod` (and an index permutation since we are \"updating leftwards\")\n",
    "- LEFT TO RIGHT SWEEP: similar to above: `for itL = (1:L-1)`, update `mpo2[itL]` and `mpo2[itL+1]` using `Vlr[itL] ` and `Vlr[itL + 3]`. Then update `Vlr[itL + 1]` using `updateLeft_mod`\n",
    "- end of cycle with index itS\n",
    "- `mpo2` should now approximately represent the square of the operator represented by `mpo`!! ...for big enough `Dmax` and `Nsweeps`"
