See source/square_mpo.jl for better description of what this function `square_mpo` should do. There, the easy case where (bond dimension of `mpo`)^2 <= Dmax is already implemented (no truncation is needed, so easy!). Here let's assume (bond dimension of `mpo`)^2 > Dmax, which requires truncation and actually understanding appendix D of the paper (sigh). This scheme closely follows ideas and in particular the indexing conventions of the lecture function `dmrg_2site`! Having a tab open with the implementation of `dmrg_2site` may help understand the scheme below.\n",

    "- Fill `Vlr[2], ..., Vlr[L + 1]` with iterative contractions of `mpo`, `mpo` and `mpo2`. For that, we can use a modified version of updateLeft, say `updateLeft_mod` (3), doing what's described in fig. 17c\n",

It also involves an SVD (5) to get `mpo2[itL-1]` and `mpo2[itL]` out of the 2-site optimized tensor ($C_i C_{i+1}$ in the paper). In particular, the updated `mpo2[itL]` must be an \"MPO-right isometry\", so that the updated `mpo2`  will be \"MPO-site canonical\" with new isometry center at site `itL - 1` (still need to really get the details of all that...). After that, update `Vlr[itL + 1]` using `updateLeft_mod` (and an index permutation since we are \"updating leftwards\")\n",
